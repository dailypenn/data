The last 1 1/2 has forced everyone to reevaluate what we we value and what we want to invest in.,Inclusivity- I understand how coming to Penn may be isolating. I want to make sure that students feel safe and heard regardless of there identity/background.,Understanding- Not many people from where I am from end up and Penn and in my short time here I have found that understanding where people come from and how that enhances the quality of life here leads to much more nuanced dialogue.,Outreach- Making sure every student is aware and available to every resource available at Penn.,Recognizing Penn's history here in Philadelphia and around the globe to help us move forward. ,https://drive.google.com/open?id=1_pgj7j4wPLLUs4y7pqF8zncLhqbkoiy3
